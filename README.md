# Ted, The Deep-Learning Chatbot

## About this Project
Ted is a multipurpose chatbot made using Python3, who can chat with you and help in performing daily tasks. It uses NLP and Deep-Learning to analyse the user's message, classify it into the a broader category and then reply with a suitable message or the required information. It is hosted using flask and is available on heroku at the link specified above. 

First, the user message is lemmatized and pre-processed, before passing it to the deep-learning model used, an Artificial Neural Network with Softmax, to specify the query category which achieves an accuracy of **over 98%**.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training was self-populated and is stored as Intents.json in chatbot_codes. The data from this file was used to create the pickle files for words and classes. The pre-trained model with weights is available as mymodel.h5 in the same file.
